# inventory_management_app
Simple inventory management application written in python. This application is intentionally written without the use of any python libraries as an exercise for expanding my knowledge and practice in python.

Usage: In its current state the code is not as useful as it could be. The code can be copied and utilized with file functions to save existing inventory data or simply used as a reference to enhance other projects.

The code includes methods to store and manage inventory items, create purchases, create returns, view historical data, view inventory statistics and maintain a till.  The inventory, purchase orders and return orders are maintained as dictionaries of dictionaries including the item name, item quantity and item price.

The user is greeted with a welcome screen and menu systems throughout the application for ease of use.

Thank you for viewing!
